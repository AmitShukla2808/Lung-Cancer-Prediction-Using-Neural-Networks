# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks
This project is a simple exploratory work to understand and explore the efficiency and accuracy of Neural Networks in easily fitting complex problems. Here we have used Neural Networks to analyse and predict if a patient has lung cancer or not given features like smoking tendencies,alcohol consumptions etc.
